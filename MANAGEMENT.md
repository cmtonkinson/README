## D. Words of Wisdom
1. For any hybrid or fully remote team, cameras on (in office or not. You'd be surprised what a difference this makes. (If at home, no one can tell if you're unshowered, and no one cares about the chaos or mess behind you.)
2. No question is too big, too small, too early, or too awkward, but a question **can** be too late.
3. Own the work. Be proactive and over communicate.
4. Prefer delegation of outcomes, not tasks.
5. Donâ€™t wait for a formal meeting invite to say what needs to be said.
6. Take up space; you have more authority than you might think.
7. Trust and verify.
8. Catch people doing things _right_.
9. Be a 360&deg; leader, I ~~don't always get things right~~ often get things wrong.
10. To your directs, you _are_ The Company&trade;. Keep that in mind as you interact, particularly as you respond to questions and concerns.
11. No bad surprises: if something is going downhill, speak up sooner than later. Attack the problem when it's small.
