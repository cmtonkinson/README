The sections & items below are all listed in no particular order (they use ordered lists only for ease of reference).

## A. Core Values
1. Respect
2. Integrity
3. Humility
4. Empathy

_(Is it too on-the-nose to point out the anagram H.I.R.E. hidden in that constellation of superlatives?)_

## B. Strategic Objectives
1. Stronger team relations: know people, grow people.
2. Monitor team for attrition risk, poor performance, succession planning, single points of failure, etc.
3. Learn the domain. Follow the market.
4. Engage meaningfully with your business partners and stakeholders.
5. "Peripheral disciplines" are crucial, too: legal, finance, marketing, product, infra, security, support, HR, operations, etc. Make friends, learn everything you can.

## C. Routine Tasks
1. Timesheets
    1. Submit by end of each day.
    2. Approve for your team Monday (before noon ET).
    3. Submit on the last business day of the month.
    4. Approve for your team on the first business day of the month (before noon ET).
2. Submit a weekly status report by EoD Friday. Minimally include {status, assignee, ETA, issues/risks, notes} for each major workstream, and any other KPI's for your specific area(s).
3. Ensure proper flow, tracking, and capitalization of work effort.
4. Provide oversight for production support and KPIs/KPOs for your platform(s).
5. Drive architecture, improvement initiatives, tech debt remediation, etc. We are technologists - push the envelope.
6. Performance monitoring for team members.
7. Respecting (read: enforcing) D.E.A.L., Shop Talk, Happy Hour, and other engagement activities.

## D. Words of Wisdom
1. For any hybrid or fully remote team, cameras on (in office or not. You'd be surprised what a difference this makes. (If at home, no one can tell if you're unshowered, and no one cares about the chaos or mess behind you.)
2. No question is too big, too small, too early, or too awkward, but a question **can** be too late.
3. Own the work. Be proactive and over communicate.
4. Prefer delegation of outcomes, not tasks.
5. Donâ€™t wait for a formal meeting invite to say what needs to be said.
6. Take up space; you have more authority than you might think.
7. Trust and verify.
8. Catch people doing things _right_.
9. Be a 360&deg; leader, I ~~don't always get things right~~ often get things wrong.
10. To your directs, you _are_ The Company&trade;. Keep that in mind as you interact, particularly as you respond to questions and concerns.
11. No bad surprises: if something is going downhill, speak up sooner than later. Attack the problem when it's small.
12. Work to be the smartest technologist in the room and always assume you're not.

## E. Rules for Debate (brainstorming, ideation, troubleshooting, etc.)
1. Reserve judgement
2. Raise alternatives, not protests
3. You are not your ideas
4. Always converse at a round table

## F. Should I Tell/Ask my Boss about `$problem`?
"Go to your boss with solutions, not problems" is a common pearl of wisdom. While pithy (and usually helpful), it's not always practical. Here's my algorithm _in order!_ for how to approach this:

1. If I can solve the problem myself, and my boss really doesn't care or need to know, I solve the problem myself.
2. If I can solve the problem myself, and my boss should be made aware, I solve the problem myself, then inform my boss at the appropriate time.
3. If I can solve the problem myself, but require approval to do so, I present my boss with my proposed solution for approval (along with any relevant context for having arrived at that recommendation).
4. If I am not certain how to solve the problem but have some ideas, I present my boss with a brief problem statement and the option(s) in mind (with any relevant context) for guidance.
5. If I truly have no idea how to attack the problem, I present the problem to my boss in the form of a question to illicit guidance / direction / feedback.

In no case do I recommend simply dumping the problem at your boss's proverbial feet with a blank stare ;-)
